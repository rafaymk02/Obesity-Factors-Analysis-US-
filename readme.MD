## Interactive Map Setup

To run our interactive map in Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries by running the following command:
pip install pandas plotly ipywidgets


2. **Open the Notebook**:
Once all the required packages are installed, open the `final_report.ipynb` notebook.

3. **Import Libraries**:
Execute the first cell at the very top of the notebook to import necessary libraries and files.

4. **Run the Interactive Visualization**:
Run the cell for our interactive visualization. You can then use the map and dropdown menu to select a race and view obesity rates by state, and an overall view with all races.
